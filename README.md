GMCWiper
========
an arduino mini pro based controller for the classic GMC motorhome windshield wipers. 
the GMC has a really cool hydraulic, variable speed wiper motor. 
What it doesn't have is intermittentness. 
and when you run the wipers real slow, they shudder and shake and do strange things.
The speed is also controlled by a 35 year old cable and is hard to adjust.
this controller uses a hobby server to both set the speed and implement intermmittent wipers.
It also causes 2 sweeps of the wipers if the user presses the mist button with the wipers off or in intermmittent mode.
